# Horus Hierolgyphic

These scripts make it possible to include Egyptian hieroglyphic into webpages.

The script "api/index.php" will show how to use the classes, it can also be used
as a Resful API - to be called by Ajax or cURL. 

## Installing:

 1. Extract the archive file NewGardiner.zip which contains the TTF-font and
    a complete set of PNG-images generated from the font.
 2. Place images and CSS-script and api/* where it can be reached. The script
    api/index.php will run as is.
